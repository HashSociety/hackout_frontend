# HeadTogether

Our project, HeadTogether is a travel companion app tailored for travelers. With our app, users can input their personal information and specify their travel intentions, whether it's exploring a new destination, sharing a cab ride, or enjoying a movie with someone. With HeadTogether, you can create and join exclusive "rooms" for specific purposes within a a specified radius, making your immediate location your password. Upon submission, our app will generate a virtual "room" based on these details, allowing users to define the room's size and set the range for visibility to others. This unique room concept is then made accessible to fellow app users within the specified range. They can explore these rooms, join discussions, and collaborate on travel plans, fostering connections and making solo adventures more engaging and social.  It's all about local synergy, where your neighbors, fellow commuters, or enthusiasts in your area can easily connect, share rides, play sports, or embark on shared activities, all by being in the right place at the right time. Whether you're seeking companionship, ride-sharing, or cultural exploration, our travel app has you covered.
